# Pet Adoption

## Welcome to my Pet Adoption site. This project displays pets that are available for adoption. The available pets are displayed on cards and can be sorted by type: cat, dog, or dino. Returning to all available pets is also possible via the All Pets button. The pet cards can also be deleted by clicking the delete button on each card. Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and Javascript were all used in the creation of this site. Some methods that this site uses are: .filter(), .splice(), .querySelector(), and .addEventListener. The user is someone who is interested in adopting a pet that is available on this website. They can see pictures, read a description, and sort by specific types of pets they may want.
